Display a scrollable list of repositories of “square” organisation in GitHub.
The app should consist of only one screen (Repositories Screen). Each list
item should have at least the name and description of the repo.

# Focused on the junit tests, I used mockk.io library.I covered data and domain layers
# As we simple app with one screen, hint it's okay as a library for DI
# Clean Architecture
# MVVM pattern
# Coroutines (StateFlow)
